This subfolder contains all of the art that I, Liliana Campuzano, created 
within a timespan of a few hours for a simple dating sim called "Romance Sandwich".
It was created for a 24 hour Game Jam hosted by my school's Game Development Club.

This was created in a team of 4: including 2 coders and 2 artists.
